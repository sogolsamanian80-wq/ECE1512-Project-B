**ECE1512 Project B**

This repository includes code files for the methods explained in our report. There are two sections with code in our report, one for Architecture Ablation (Temperature) and one for Loss Function Ablation (Focal loss).

**To run the codes:**

Download, rename, and replace the config files.

Open temperature_added_testing.ipynb or focal_loss_testing.ipynb

Either add the necessary files manually and run the first block in temperature_added_testing.ipynb, or change the drive path to link to yours.

Run the rest of the sections.


Thank you so much for taking the time to check this file and code. Any criticism is highly appreciated!
